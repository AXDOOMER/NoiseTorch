## Probable insecurity / remove NoiseTorch

At least one of my sytems has probably been compromised, dont use the source either. One could hide things in a large diff.
Therefore you should for now remove NoiseTorch from your systems, until this issue is cleared up:

~~~
rm ~/.local/bin/noisetorch
rm ~/.local/share/applications/noisetorch.desktop
rm ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/noisetorch.png
~~~

## Seeking help with code review

If the community can help review ALL of the code, maybe we can trust the code again and work from there.
