## Probable insecurity / remove NoiseTorch

At least one of the original developers' (@lawl) systems has probably been compromised. Due to that we currently can not expect the source code NOR the binaries to be secure.
Therefore you should for now remove NoiseTorch from your systems, until this issue is cleared up:

~~~
rm ~/.local/bin/noisetorch
rm ~/.local/share/applications/noisetorch.desktop
rm ~/.local/share/icons/hicolor/256x256/apps/noisetorch.png
~~~

## Seeking help with code review

If the community can help review ALL of the code, maybe we can trust the code again and work from there.
